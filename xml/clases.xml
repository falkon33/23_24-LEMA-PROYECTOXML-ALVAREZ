            <feature>Rage: In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a
                rage as a bonus action.
                While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
                -You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
                -When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage
                roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
                column of the Barbarian table.
                -You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
                If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while
                raging.
                Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
                your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or
                taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
                Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages
                column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage
                again.</feature>
            <feature>Unarmored defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor⁠ Class
                equals 10
                + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and
                still
                gain this benefit.</feature>

            <feature>Shelter of the Faithful: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
                share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You
                and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a
                temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide
                any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will
                support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
                You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or
                pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to
                serve, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can
                call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not
                hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</feature>
            <feature>Channel Divinity: At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
                directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with
                two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains
                grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain
                description.
                When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then
                finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
                Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect
                from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
                Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and
                beginning at 18th level. you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a
                short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</feature>
            <feature>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead: As an action, you present your holy sym⁠bol and
                speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30
                feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
                it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
                A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
                can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t
                take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
                from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the
                creature can use the Dodge action.</feature>
            <feature>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life: Starting at 2nd level, you can use your
                Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.
                As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore
                a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures
                within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can
                restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this
                feature on an undead or a construct.</feature>

            <feature>Thieves' Cant: During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret
                mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
                normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such
                messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message⁠ than it does to speak
                the same idea plainly.
                In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short,
                simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’
                guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or
                will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</feature>
            <feature>Sneak Attack: Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit
                a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one creature
                you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use
                a finesse or a ranged weapon.
                You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within
                5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the
                attack roll.
                The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown
                in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</feature>
            <feature>Lucky: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you
                can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</feature>
            <feature>Brave: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</feature>
            <feature>Halfling Nimbleness: You can move through the space of any creature that is of
                a size larger than yours.</feature>
            <feature>Naturally Stealthy: You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by
                a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</feature>
            <feature>Shelter of the Faithful: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
                share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You
                and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a
                temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide
                any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will
                support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
                You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or
                pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to
                serve, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can
                call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not
                hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</feature>
            <feature>Cunning Action: Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow
                you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in
                combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</feature>
            <feature>Fast Hands: Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
                Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools
                to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</feature>
            <feature>Second-Story Work: When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the
                ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.
                In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a
                number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</feature>

            <feature>Ritual Casting: You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the
                ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the
                spell prepared.</feature>
            <feature>Arcane Recovery: You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by
                studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose
                expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is
                equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can
                be 6th level or higher.
                For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of
                spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell
                slots.</feature>
            <feature>Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and
                magic can’t put you to sleep.</feature>
            <feature>Trance: Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
                semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”)
                While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
                exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in
                this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</feature>
            <feature>Darkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior
                vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as
                if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern
                color in darkness, only shades of gray.</feature>
